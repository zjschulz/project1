# Project1

This is the CLI Data Gem project for the Procedural/Object Orientation Ruby Module of Flat Iron's Structure - Online Software Engineering bootcamp.

This project focuses on scraping and initializing data from a foreign website, then taking that data and incorporating it into a command line interface (CLI) for a user to use.

My project's focus is to scrape retired racehorse listings from the official Retired Racehorse Project website. That data will then be incorporated into an interface that will allow the user to search/view numerous listings.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'project1'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install project1

## Usage

To initialize the program:

    $ ./bin/project1
    
Follow the instruction provided.  

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
